# LeetCode Solution Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solution Repository**! 🎯

This repository is dedicated to solving algorithmic challenges from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) using **Python**. It includes problems across all difficulty levels — **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** — and is a personal initiative to:

- Sharpen my problem-solving skills 🤔
- Learn and apply core computer science concepts 🔧
- Improve my proficiency in Python 🐍
- Track my learning and development as a software developer 📈

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder is categorized by difficulty or topic:

```
EasyLC/          # Easy-level LeetCode problems
MediumLC/        # Medium-level problems (planned)
HardLC/          # Hard-level problems (planned)
README.md        # Problem-specific README files
```

## ✅ Goals

- [x] Build a consistent daily coding habit
- [x] Document every solution with clean code and explanation
- [x] Push myself beyond just solving — focus on writing optimal code
- [ ] Begin contributing to Medium and Hard problems
- [ ] Implement test cases using `unittest` or `pytest`

## 🚀 Why This Repository?

I believe in learning by doing. By actively solving problems and documenting them, I not only enhance my own understanding but also create a reference that could help others.

Whether you’re reviewing for interviews or sharpening your coding muscle, I hope this repository can be useful to you too.
